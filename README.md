This is a matlab/simulink model of "dynamic mode AFM"  
It simulates the operation of Atomic force microscope working in non-contact oscillation mode with frequency feedback.
it models an oscillator, a lock-in amplifier with pll and an "auto excitation" mechanism with amplitude feedback
The interaction force is set according to Lennard-Jones potential.
